description: "Botanic Romantic is a foraging guide and interdisciplinary art project which celebrates the wonder of seemingly mundane or weedy yet edible plants."

Started during an art residency on the grounds of the former Kirkbride State Hospital in Fergus Falls, Minnesota in spring 2017, it aims to be experimental yet educational, both sassy and non-apologetically personal. 

The five plants presently featured were discovered while exploring city parks, bike trails, wilderness research areas, and other public or tax-forfeit wilderness areas within the city limits of Fergus Falls – as well as state, county, and/or DNR-maintained lands throughout Otter Tail county.

I want to encourage others to do the same: take your bike out to unfamiliar parks. Or go camping and rent a canoe for the day. Then look for something unfamiliar and try to pick out visual clues to what it is. The more time you spend looking for telling details, the easier it gets.

Plant identification certainly isn't _easy_ – some plants have inedible or poisonous lookalikes, and correct indentification is often much simpler during the brief window of time a plant flowers, sprouts seeds, or produces fruit. 

But it's my hope that this project inspires others to get outside and wander about with a similiar sense of curiosity about the value and relevance of unfamiliar plants growing in seemingly ordinary areas.

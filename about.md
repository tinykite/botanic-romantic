# About
{: .alt-headline}

Botanic Romantic is an online foraging guide and misfit art beast that exists somewhere in the borderlands between horticultural education, food/humor writing, and health advocacy.

I started working on the project in early 2017, during a two-month arts residency at Hinge Arts at the Kirkbride, in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. I wanted to make horticultural education just a little funnier and weirder — and to explore how minimalist illustration might promote the beauty of odd plants. 

My residency began in April, before the ground had even thawed. I had no idea what kind of plants were most prolific (and most edible) in the area. I wasn't even a good cook. 

But I was eager to get outside and explore. 

So I spent much of my residency exploring city parks, bike trails, and public and/or tax-forfeit wilderness areas in Fergus Falls, plus huge swaths of DNR-maintained land throughout greater Otter Tail county. I talked to anyone, and everyone I could. I awkwardly read maps. I made a lot of terrible sketches.

Since those early days, the project has spawned a website, a pop-up cocktail bar, a print run of 500 handmade letterpress coasters, and a family-oriented "art of weeds" class that combined herbal education with storytelling and design thinking.

In the future, I want to do more: more recipes, more illustrations, more experimental interactive design work. I want to keep exploring, and keep finding ways to reimagine the value of seemingly mundane plants.

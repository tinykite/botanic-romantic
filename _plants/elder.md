TL:DR; Don't be fooled by the name. The magic this plant spins is an all-ages affair. 

Throughout Europe, the Elder tree is traditionally believed to be inhabited by the spirit of a mystical woman. In the British Isles, she is the White Goddess, who ruled the underworld. In Denmark, she is Hyldemoer, the Elder Mother. And in the Swiss Alps ashe is known as Frau Holla or Perchta, the tk tk tk tk tk tk. 

According to folklore, while often seen as motherly, protective figures, they are also portrayed as outright vengeful.

The elder goddess is revered throughout Europe for reasons ranging from her gifts to cuisine – from elder-flavored ice cream to syrup, liquer, and even pastilles – to her ability to cure ailments. Once used in remedies for everything from wounds and warts to even blindness and the common toothache, more contemporary research has often focused on the elderberry’s usefulness for reducing the severity and length of respiratory illnesses such as cold and flu. 

There is, of course, the notion that the tree has a dark side. Its leaves and twigs are poisonous, and if the berries, seeds, or blossoms are eaten uncooked, they can cause intense nausea. In folklore, while Elder is often portrayed as benevolent, destroying or cutting down a tree without so much as a little prayer or ritual was said to unleash the fury of the goddess inside. 

According to some legends, burning the tree would even cause it to scream and spit at you – “the screaming of the devil.” Even more curiously, while Elder is revered for its powers to protect the inhabitants of nearby homes and drive away dark forces and uninvited guests, it has also been negatively associated with witchcraft and dark arts.

An 1889 edition of the Popular Science Monthly claims witches are thought to create bad weather by stirring water with branches of Elder. Christian-era lore in Ireland talks of witches disgusing themselves as Elder or using them to drive horses. Tk tk tk tk tk, and tk tk tk tk tk; and tk tk tk tk tk tk tk tk tk tk. 

Not everyone, it would appear, always loves a strong woman.

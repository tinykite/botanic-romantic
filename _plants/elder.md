Don't be fooled by the name. The magic this plant spins is an all-ages affair. 

I remember when I first discovered the subtle, almost delicate flavor of elderflower-infused beverages. My friend Lizzy friend had invited me over under the premise that we’d do nothing but hang out on her front porch and get drunk on wine. 

“We’ll pretend to be old ladies together,” she joked. I enthusiastically accepted. 

When I arrived, Lizzy poured me a glass of white wine — added a small splash of soda water — and then finished it off with elderflower syrup. This is, as I’ve come to know it, a variation on the Hungarian wine spritzer, aka the frocc. Created by writer and journalist Gyula Krudy, who drank them regularly with inventor TK — the first person to produce soda water on an industrial scale, in TK — it is even potentially the very first wine spritzer. 

I solemnly promise to never mock wine spritzers because of it.

After Lizzy poured the frocc, I carried it to her front porch and sunk into one of her antique rocking chairs. I took a sip and let the drink’s floral, sweet booziness wash over me. I pushed back in the chair. And I remember thinking that there was something about co-opting a faux old lady lifestyle like this that felt better, and more satisfying, than anything. 

As an old lady, I reasoned, I might finally feel old enough to not give a shit. I might be able to not care about anyone — or anything. Or, nothing more important than a glass of wine and a moderately comfortable rocking chair. Adopting some sort of Golden Girls-esque persona permanently felt brilliant. 

This was, if nothing else, an eerily appropriate introduction to the elder tree.

In much eastern and western european folklore, the tree is believed to be inhabited by the spirit of a powerful, elderly woman. In Denmark, she is known as Hyldemoer, the Elder Mother; in the British Isles, she is the White Goddess, who ruled the underworld; and in the Swiss Alps, she is Frau Holla or Perchta. 

She is typically portrayed as a motherly figure, someone who bestow benefits and protection on those who live nearest to a tree. [Need example? Maybe from Hans Christenson?] 

The elder spirit also has a dark side. Cutting down or burning an Elder tree, or doing so without saying a prayer to the elder spirit first, appears to invite terrible luck. It will unleash the vengeful wrath of the spirit on not only on yourself, but also your entire family.

Elder trees also have strong connotations with witchcraft. In Ireland, witches often disguised themselves as elder trees. Some sources even say that burning the hollow branches of the elder tree will even unleash the “screaming of the devil.” 

Not everyone, I guess, is pleased by the sight of a strong woman?  

The notion that Elder trees can cause harm isn’t entirely unfounded, though. According to the Nordic Food Lab, the tree carries cyanide in the form of glycosides — and while your liver will naturally eliminate small levels of cyanide, ingesting any amount of leaves, branches, bark, roots, stems, or unripe fruits from the Elder tree might overwhelm it, and provoke nausea, vomiting, feelings of general weakness, and dizziness.

At high enough concentrations (as little as 37.8 milligrams, but more typically 98 mg in one day), the glycosides carried by an Elder tree may even cause death. But try not to worry too much about that: what we know today is that cyanide also has a boiling point of 78.26 degrees fahrenheit, “which means that even a little heat would vaporise the toxin and make the product safer,” notes the Nordic Food Lab. 

Additionally, the non-profit foundation notes, eating fully ripe fruits is generally considered safe.

Foraging Elder OR Dropcap
So where can you find an elder in the world? You will typically spot it as a small tree or bush. It blooms in late May, and its fruits can be discovered in late summer and early fall. [Fact-check this!!]

Two varieties of the tree, TK and TK, are fairly prevalent through North America and can be used in recipes fairly interchangeably — although in BITTERS BOOK, AUTHOR NOTES X. Only pick from these, not the berries of the red elder — which are considered by many experts to be too toxic for use in herbal medicine or in culinary applications.

Elder in Traditional Herbal Medicine OR dropcap
Western herbalists often turn to Elder during flu season for what, as the University of Maryland Medical Center notes, may be the presence of 

 It is also an ancient remedy for treating respiratory complaints ranging from X to Y— and believed to particularly effective as a remedy for the very young and the very old. 

Evidence-backed research backs some of these claims, including the increasingly mainstream belief that chemicals in elderflower as well as berries, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, “may help reduce swelling in mucous membranes, including the sinuses, and help relieve nasal congestion.”

 according to the University of Maryland Medical Center the belief that “chemicals in elder flower and berries may help reduce swelling in mucous membranes, including the sinuses, and help relieve nasal congestion.” The center adds, “Elder may have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-influenza, and anticancer properties.”

Additionally, the center notes that elderberries are also a rich source of flavonoids — even higher than blueberries, cranberries, or goji berries — which may prevent cell damage in the body.

Evidence-based research aside, elders are also curiously a something something something….. Wild ravings

It has also notably been used by herbalists to settle “wild ravings” and wakefulness, which is — as my friend and herbalist Siloh Radovsky puts it — perhaps a reflection on its relationship to journeys (including journeys to the underworld, as much folklore believes) and to the imagination.

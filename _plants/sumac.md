TL:DR; A little sour. Some even call it tart. But we all know that’s just another way of saying that its flavor is opinionated.

Sumac is most easily described as the red thing on the highway. It commonly grows alongs the margins of both roadsides and railroad tracks, and can easily be spotted on walks in both forests and on the edges of creeks and marshes. 

It often grows prolifically (and some might say aggressively) but not without a purpose.

The plant’s dense thickets can thrive on even deeply rocky or hilly terrain, providing ground cover on what might otherwise be bare, not particularly attractive areas of land. It also stabilizes hillsides and can be used to prevent erosion. 

While more commonly resembling a bush, Sumac can grow as tall as 30 to 35 feet.

Its attractive, pyramidal berries – often easily spotted from a distance – are an attractive source of food for more than 30 types of mammals. Or in other words, its scarlet plumes bring all the wildlife to the yard.

Resourceful cooks (including even the Romans) have been substituting sumac in place of lemon for ages. But this ain’t no poor man’s lemonade. The flavor of a Sumac berry can be described as both citrus and earthy, astringent and warm. It is less sour than a lemon, and arguably more complex. 

Sumac is commonly made into a refreshing tea, and it is also a worthy spice rub for meat dishes. Or try it as a simple finishing touch on top of a meal – which is precisely how many Middle Eastern kitchens prepare it, into a spice mix known as Za’atar.

What’s not to love?

There are pretenders, of course, who claim that sumac is poisonous. Don’t believe these fools! Staghorn and its cousin, Smooth, are only related to an unruly plant known, somewhat unimaginatively, as poison sumac. 

Poison sumac has white berries, in contrast the red berries so often associated with Staghorn and Smooth sumac.

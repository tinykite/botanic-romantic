Not everything has a pretty name. This one doesn't. But there's poetry in the thorny nature of this plant, I promise. 

I don't know who christened the moniker "Stinging Nettle." 

It’s a little basic and unimaginative, like deciding to name your new fancy superfood “nutritious green thing” or going rogue and labeling every single brand of fancy cereal in Whole Foods “cardboard morning snacks.”

But then there's Stinging Nettle’s scientific name, <em>Urtica Dioica</em>, which redeems it all. It's nothing short of heavy metal. The name derives from the latin verb Urere, to burn. Which means this is a plant that gets to run around all day screaming “HELLO I BURN!”, a phrase that obviously couldn't get any more hardcore if it tried. 

The intrigue thickens from there. Nettles commonly thrive alongside creeks and rivers, in wet meadows, in mucky wetlands, and moist soil contaminated or enriched by nitrates and uric acid waste products (including those leached by septic tanks, and animals when they pee).

Why am I mentionining this? It's kind of gross. And probably boring: a plant grows by the river. How exciting. But according to herbal lore, the plant’s proximity to water – or even watery things – is more than anecdotal. Herbalist and author Siloh Radovsky notes that nettles are considered the “land plants most closely associated with the ocean.” 

They are highly nutritious (not unlike seaweed) and, she says – if we view the body as a sort of vast, metaphorical ocean – one of the keys to improving the painful or uncomfortable stagnation of its fluids. 

More specifically, nettles are a remedy for conditions that include bloating and excessive water retention; as an aid to chronic inflammation of the bladder and the urination problems that accompany the early stages of benign prostatic hyperplasia (aka an uncomfortably enlarged prostate); as a blood purifier and kidney tonic; and even as a tea that encourages milk production in new mothers. 

Just try and tell me that’s not poetic.

<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>here is also a dark elegance to the way nettles administer their signature burn. Each plant carries specialized hairs that are endowed with a bulbous tip, which sits like a cap on top of a syringe-like tube. When an unsuspecting creature or unfortunate human brushes up against the plant's hairs, the tip simply breaks — and the syringe is free to sally forth and inject its victim with a punishing load of histamine and acetylcholine.

Not everyone who comes into contact with these chemicals is an unfortunate soul, however. Roman legionnaires are storied to have intentionally lashed themselves with nettles to feel warm during winter.

They aren’t alone. (At least not anymore.) Grazing or flogging yourself with the plant (or “urtication” as it is formally known) is a well-established, medicinally beneficial act. Herbal experts say the temporary burning sensation caused by contact with the plant can provide relief for the ongoing pain of conditions such as sciatica and arthritis; it can reawaken paralyzed or functionally inactive/atrophied limbs; and it can increase nerve communication.  

Nettles are environmentally useful as well. Namely, they are host to a variety of cutely-named butterflies, including Milbert's Tortoiseshell, Red Admiral, Eastern Comma, the Question Mark, and the Satyr Comma.

As a tasty wild edible, the plant can be cooked much like any leafy green – or included in pestos, soups, cordials, and herbal tea. And according to the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, nettles are even a beloved component of heritage cheese production (specifically Cornish Yarg) and a common way for British farmers to fatten up their pigs.

Not bad for a hairy plant that others loves to hate.

## HARVEST TIPS

Radovsky recommends gathering nettle leaves in the spring and early summer, before flowering. After flowering, the mature plants can form calcium carbonate cystoliths, which she notes may irritate the kidneys and contribute to the formation of kidney stones.  

Don’t let that scare you off though. Nettles are a nutritive tonic high in protein, minerals, and vitamins – including Iron, Calcium, Potassium, and the Vitamins A, C and D. They can be eaten, juiced, prepared fresh, or dried. If drying, bundle the plants together at the stem. 

Note: The stinging hairs become inactive after drying, but be careful – according to herbalist Michael Moore, some plants may have large enough hairs that can irritate mechanically, even after drying.

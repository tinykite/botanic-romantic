TL:DR; Not the showiest pony on any ranch. But humble doesn't mean homely.  

Sweet Cicely often hides in plain sight amongst other, more decorative displays of foliage, in moist woods or alongside streams and lakes. It's relatively common throughout the midwest, yet no longer terribly well known. 

That's a shame, because there is something genuinely sweet about it. For a hint of it, crush the leaves in your hand and try to get a whiff of the fragrance that escapes. For both the Sweet Cicely which prominently grows in America (sometimes known as Aniseroot), as well as its British neighbor, the scent is earthy and licorice-like. 

What causes the smell? Not important. I mean, science is cool guys. But what the smell conveys is a sort of je ne sais quoi quality that is incredi....  

 in the fragrance that escapes. a fragrance will escape: something earthy and licorice-like.  

What causes the smell? It’s not terribly important. I mean, it is (science is cool, guys) – but what is more relevant is what that smell means about sweet cicely’s potential for use in the world of cooking and medicine. 

In the world of food, there's a cool group of spices everyone knows. A group that includes basil, licorice, tarragon, fennel, and star anise. None of these spices really share any relation in terms of family or biology, not unlike the way in which other cool kids (your heathers, ashleys, plastics, etc) aren't typically related either – yet all share a sort of unmistable je ne sais quois.  

But cool kids do all share a sort of unmistakable je ne sais quois. And in this case, the je ne sais quois is how much they smell. A lot. But in a good way! 

The outsized odor they each impart is thanks to organic compounds that include anethole, a substance 14 times sweeter than sugar. Anethole isn’t manipulated into an easily usable form in the same way sugar is, because… Apparently undesirable bad things happen (Citation needed). 

Its unique odor and sweetness is, however, one of the reasons licorice is so popular and versatile, with use everywhere from Absinthe, to the Danish candy salte fiske, to a soothing cup of Throat Coat and also – incredibly frequently – to worldwide use as a flavoring agent in cigarettes.

Despite its ubiquity however, the culinary form of licorice (not to be confused with American licorice) isn’t common to this side of the pond. Or, in fact, this side of the hemisphere. It is primarily cultivated, according to the NIH, in Greece, Turkey, and Asia, in a lengthy growing process that takes three years to produce a sizeable root. 

But you know what also tastes a lot like licorice? And includes that special, special substance known as anethole? Why, just a humble little sweet thing that grows wild in Minnesota, from moist woods and the rich perimeters of creeks and rivers and lakes to even the rather unremarkable edges of this humble author’s suburban yard. 

Sweet Cicely doesn’t enjoy the attention that licorice does in the world of herbal and complementary/alternative medicine. The anecdotal research available on its medical applications is sparse in comparison. However, the herbalist Matthew Wood notes of its usefulness in the treatment of type II diabetes in The Earthwise Herbal: A Complete Guide to New World Medicinal Plants (“It is specific for helping the cells pick up more blood sugar”).

And according to driftless region herbalist Adrian White, it s 

## Sweet Cicely Champagne Soda
Recipe by S.F. Keough

Gather a bunch of Sweet Cicely flowers (8-10 heads should do)
1.5 lbs of sugar
1 gallon of cold filtered water
1 lemon, juice plus skin cut into chunks after removing the pith 
3T white wine vinegar

Dissolve the sugar in about two cups of warm water, let it cool, then mix all ingredients together in a big container. Cover it and leave it somewhere dark and a bit cool for 4 days. If it gets too hot, the lemon might mold. If you see that happening, just skim it off. After four days, strain and pour the liquid into bottles. Glass bottles look nicer but plastic is safer just in case your soda gets too fizzy. In any case, unscrew the lids every couple days to let off some pressure. Keep them at room temperature for 4-10 days, checking their taste along the way. Once it’s to your liking, you can pop it in the fridge to slow down the fermentation process. This refreshing beverage is a delight on its own and has an anise-y flavor with a little extra sweetness. Add a lemon slice and some ice, or why not some gin too? 

Note: Fermented drinks do contain a small percentage of alcohol and the longer you let them ferment, the higher the percentage.

## Sweet Cicely Ice Cream — for ice cream maker
Recipe by Siloh Radovsky

1-2 cups fresh, chopped Sweet Cicely leaves, stems, and seed-pods, and optional roots
2 cups whole milk or non-dairy milk of your choice (ideally something fatty like coconut or hemp)
1/2 - 1 cup honey, sugar, or maple syrup (use more or less sweetener to taste)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
2 cups heavy cream or more whole milk

In a medium saucepan, combine the fresh Sweet Cicely and 2 cups of whole milk. Bring the mixture to barely a simmer and then remove from heat. Allow to steep covered for 45 minutes. Strain the milk into a large jar or mixing bowl — it should be a lovely shade of green, much like green tea ice cream! (You can now discard the Sweet Cicely.) Stir in the sweetener of your choice into the infused milk until it’s dissolved, along with the vanilla extract. At this point, let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours. Once it’s nice and cool, stir in two more cups of cream or milk. Use this mixture according to the directions of your ice cream maker to make a gorgeous, anise-sweet ice cream. Serve alone or with angel-food cake.

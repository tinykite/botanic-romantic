If a plant grows where you want it to, you might say that it grows vigorously. But if it doesn’t? That thing is a weed. Its delicate, small flowers are a menace. 

And the common wild violet, a perennial pain in the ass for some gardeners, is no exception.

Like many tenacious plants, violets survive by sending out seeds and thick networks of underground rhizomes. 

 But there's also something else, something wonderful, that prevents gardeners from gaining the upper hand. It’s known as a cleistogamous flower, a type of underground bud that doesn’t require sunlight or even the help of a pollinator to produce seeds. 

That’s because, as the Chestnut School of Herbal Medicine notes, unlike the more free-wheeling, free love ways of more typical flowers, “cleistogamous flowers are in a closed relationship with themselves."

Essentially, the underground flowers that violets grow are _so bad-ass_ that they don't need anyone else.

<span class="firstcharacter">H</span>istorically, violets proliferate today after centuries of intense popularity. The Minneapolis botanist, native plant advocate, and educator Eloise Butler felt violets were second in beauty only to roses.

She planted them frequently in her public gardens, and wrote in the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1911 that even a man “supposedly guiltless of dropping into poetry” could fall in love with them.

If he were ever to stumble upon them by accident, she wrote, he would suddenly feel so happy and enraptured that he would find himself crooning, “I would rather know where violets grow than a good many things!”

Or in other words, even the least poetic among us are capable of admiring something others call a weed.

Particularly during the Victorian era, a sort of violet mania emerged in England. The sweet-smelling cousin of wild violet, known as sweet violet, became a household staple as a perfume component and sold on the streets in bouquets known as nosegays. 

During an era of high enthusiasm for guides detailing the so-called Language of Flowers, violets also took on a deep symbolism, sometimes symbolizing virtues such as chastity and faithfulness, but also taking on graver meanings of untimely death and mourning.

In Hamlet, Ophelia mourns, "I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died" Stricken by grief, Ophelia later drowns in a river while picking flowers, a scene the pre-Raphaelite painter Sir John Everett Millais depicted in Ophelia (1851-2).

According to the Tate Museum, violets are among the symbolic plants Millais included in the painting – they appear in a woven flower chain around her neck.

According to Hyperallergic, violets are also depicted in Ford Madox Brown's painting, "Convalescent, Portrait of the Artist's Wife" which also, errily, mourns the all-too-soon death of a woman.

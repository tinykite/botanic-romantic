Some say it’s a perennial pain in the ass. Attack it early and often to protect the sanctity of your yard. 

I grew up in a suburb just south of Saint Paul, Minnesota, where I recently returned to stay, despite many misgivings about the blandness of a suburb known primarily for its proximity to no less than three major highways; and the convenience that provides to nearly a dozen large employers, including Thomson Reuters, which hosts an estimated 6,700 employees in its mammoth Pilot Knob compound alone.

But that said, it’s not all bland. You can also amble down a paved bike/pedestrian path to Lebanon Hills Regional Park, a place which boasts nearly 2,600 acres of canoeing, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and even cross-country skiing. If you’re any kind of sports-obsessed human, you might also feel enticed by the news that the Vikings are moving to a new, elaborately landscape training here in just a couple of years —

And while I wouldn’t exactly call the development I grew up in charming, there is something strangely routine and almost even comforting about watching the mostly retired residents of it putter around their yards. They move slowly, methodically, as they wield a changing array of serious-looking tools, from weed whackers to strange XXL pitchforks, that I assume are all used in some service to continue an ageless campaign against untidy growth or uninvited botanical guests to the yard. 

My parents don’t really have much in the way of gardening goals. Ferns have — rather happily — almost completely taken over what remains of our front yard flower beds. A variety of opportunistic plants, including wild violet, have also taken up residence all over our lawn. 

My parents don’t mind. Which is perhaps for the best.

Because wild violet doesn’t care about any of your hopes or dreams. They have zero shits to give. Large colonies of it can — and will — spread like small-town gossip throughout your yard. 

The curious thing about violets isn’t how fast they spread, however. Instead, it’s how they do it: not only with seeds and underground networks of spindly rhizomes, but even super-secret, pale-white buds. Known as _cleistogamous flowers_, these secret beauties (named after the latin term for a closed or “self” marriage) can hide underground because they don’t need pollinators or even the sun to produce viable seeds. 

They can pollinate themselves just fine thanks, even in the dark. 

If you follow the advice of many gardening websites, a campaign of pesticide-fueled annihilation is your only hope of reducing a scourge such as this. But the leaves and flowers of violets are surprisingly edible; and not everyone views the appearance of a cluster of these tiny, purple beauties as an assault on common decency.

The botanist Eloise Butler (an early advocate for natural conservation and the protection of native plants) often and rather intentionally planted many varieties of violets in her gardens. She believed no other flower, save a red rose, was as beautiful. And while she most famously opened the Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden in Minneapolis in 1907 (which today remains the oldest wildflower garden in America) — she also wrote a regular column for the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

In 1911, she wrote that even a man “supposedly guiltless of dropping into poetry” could fall deeply, madly in love with the common blue violet. And she wasn’t the only one to wax romantic about the flower. 

As early as 1620 lozenges known as violet tables were flavored with the fragrant, european cousin of the common blue violet (known as sweet violet). Violets have also been cooked or incorporated into a variety of sweets and candies, including flower pastries, sweet meats, and the infamous British parma violets; they have been included as thickening agents in soups; and during the Edwardian era, it was popular to infuse them into medicinal chocolates or liquor as a cure for nausea. 

None of this seems to compare, however, to the feverish wonder that once existed for violet as a perfume, a bouquet, or even a simple posey. Napoleon famously wore violets as a symbol of his victorious return from exile — and violet posies even have cameos in some of the cherished, famous works of art and literature. 

In _Hamlet_, Ophelia laments that she would have picked a posy of the purple flowers, but they “withered with the death of [her] father.” She drowns in a stream surrounded by flowers, a scene depicted in the Sir John Everett Millais painting, _Ophelia_.

The Tate museum notes that each flower depicted was carefully chosen for symbolism, and that violets, “which Ophelia wears in a chain around her neck, stand for faithfulness, chastity, or death of the young, any of which meanings could apply here.”

Violets are also depicted in Ford Madox Brown's painting, _Convalescent, Portrait of the Artist's Wife_ which, again, mourns the all-too-soon death of a woman.

In addition to fine art, the symbolic language of flowers also had a heyday in 19th century literary flower dictionaries for women. The content of each of these guides (such as _Flora’s Dictionary_, published in 1829) appears to have varied, based on scientific information, folklore, and sometimes purely arbitrary nonsense. But it also invariably was based on the traditional roles and virtues expected of women in America and abroad. 

As scholar Corinne Kopcik Rhyner notes in her dissertation, “Flowers of Rhetoric,” on the prevalence of the language of flowers in 19th century American literature, “In America the language of flowers was a popular phenomenon [...] traditionally associated with True Womanhood ideals for women to be pious, pure, domestic, and submissive to their husbands.”

I just barfed. But not all is lost —

Pure, unadulterated submissiveness isn’t the only “secret” of a flower like violet. 

Rhyner notes that the language of flowers gained popularity in the Western world only after its introduction by German Orientalist Josepher Hammer-Purcell. During a stay in Turkey, Hammer-Purcell had studied a precursor to the language, which had intimate ties to sélams, “a form of covert communication in which the exchange of symbolic objects, including but not limited to flowers, allowed cloistered harem girls to communicate with love interests outside of their walls.”

These coded messages weren’t, as Hammer-Purcell might have first assumed, a form of communication between a man and a woman, however — women used them as a friendly game amongst other women, to entertain themselves, and as a way to communicate queer desire. 

I think that connotation is more fascinating than any other bullshit meaning. It isn’t even the first time flowers have communicated love: in Greek times, the violet was reportedly the flower chiefly associated with the homoerotic overtures of the lyrist Sappho. 

Whether or not, as some scholars now question, Sappho was really the beacon of queer power in her personal life that some believe, this all amounts to a mountain of love for a seemingly simple weed.

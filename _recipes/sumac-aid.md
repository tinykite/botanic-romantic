### Ingredients
- 3-4 berry clusters
- 1 quart of cold water

### Directions
1. Go out and find a bunch of sumac growing somewhere, like along a lake or a river, or at the edge of a forest, or maybe your yard or your neighbor’s yard. This is best in early to mid summer. 
2. Harvest whole stalks of the red berries. For a quart jar’s worth of sumac-ade, use 3-4 of these berry clusters, or more for added strength. Place them into your jar, cover with cool water, and chill for an hour while the berries cold-infuse into the water. 
3. Decant over ice by pouring into serving glasses through a small strainer to catch any stray berries or fuzz. This is the best drink for the hottest days. 

_Note:_ You can add vodka for a lemonade-like cocktail!

_Serves 1 // Recipe by Siloh Radovsky_

This tea replicates a light and sweet Elderflower cordial I tried once and whose flavor eluded me until adding the tart, fresh acidity of lemon. The licorice lends some necessary sweetness and mellows out the “skunkiness” of elderflower, emphasizing its pleasant floral taste. I love this as hot tea in the winter, especially because Elder is immune-stimulating. 

### Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon dried Elder flowers
- 1 teaspoon dried licorice root (or Sweet Cicely root!)
- Wedge of fresh lemon 

### Directions
1. Steep for 5-10 minutes in 8 ounces of just-boiled water, and sweeten to taste. 

_Note_: In the summer, try making a concentrated iced tea of just the licorce and elder, and adding it to sparkling water with lemon for a refreshing drink.

This tea replicates a light and sweet elderflower cordial I tried once and whose flavor eluded me until adding the tart, fresh acidity of lemon. The licorice lends some necessary sweetness and mellows out the “skunkiness” of elderflower, emphasizing its pleasant floral taste. I love this as hot tea in the winter, especially because elder is immune-stimulating. 

### Ingredients
- 1 heaping tablespoon dried elderflowers
- 1 teaspoon dried licorice root (or sweet cicely root!)
- ½ fresh lemon, sliced
- Honey to taste

### Directions
Steep for 5-10 minutes, covered, in 16 ounces of just-boiled water, and sweeten with honey to taste. 

Note: In the summer, try making an iced tea of just the licorice and elder by decreasing the volume of water to 8oz and adding this concentrate to sparkling water with lemon for a refreshing drink.

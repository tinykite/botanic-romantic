This tea replicates a light and sweet elderflower cordial I tried once and whose flavor eluded me until adding the tart, fresh acidity of lemon. The licorice lends some necessary sweetness and mellows out the “skunkiness” of elderflower, emphasizing its pleasant floral taste. 

I love this as hot tea in the winter, especially because elder is immune-stimulating. In the summer, try making it iced: just make an 8oz concentrate (instead of 16), then add it to sparkling water with lemon for a refreshing drink. _Serves 2_

### Ingredients
- 1 heaping tablespoon dried elderflowers
- 1 teaspoon dried licorice root (or sweet cicely root!)
- ½ fresh lemon, sliced
- Honey to taste

### Directions
Steep for 5-10 minutes, covered, in 16 ounces of just-boiled water, and sweeten with honey to taste.
